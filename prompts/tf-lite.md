# /tf-lite

Deprecated alias for `/tf`. Please use `/tf` instead.

## Usage

```
/tf-lite <ticket-id> [--auto] [--no-research] [--with-research] [--plan] [--dry-run]
                 [--create-followups] [--simplify-tickets] [--final-review-loop]
```

## Execution

Runs the same workflow as `/tf` (model-switch for sequential phases, parallel reviewer subagents only).
