# Ralph Loop: Lessons Learned

This file contains lessons learned during autonomous ticket processing.
It is read by the implementer at the start of each iteration for re-anchoring.

## How This Works

When running in a Ralph loop, the agent reads this file to:
- Apply discovered patterns and conventions
- Avoid known gotchas and pitfalls
- Reuse successful strategies

## Project Patterns

<!-- Discovered patterns and conventions go here -->

## Gotchas

<!-- Things that caused issues and how to avoid them -->

## Successful Strategies

<!-- Approaches that worked well -->

## Technical Debt Notes

<!-- Known issues to address later -->

<!-- Lessons are auto-appended below by the closer agent -->
