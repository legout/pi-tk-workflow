# Project Agents

This file contains project-specific patterns, conventions, and guidelines for AI agents working on this codebase.

## Project Patterns

<!-- Add your project's recurring patterns here -->

### Code Style
- Language/Framework: <e.g., TypeScript with strict mode>
- Linter/Formatter: <e.g., ESLint + Prettier>
- Test Framework: <e.g., Vitest with MSW for mocking>

### Architecture Patterns
- <Pattern 1: e.g., All API calls go through `src/lib/api.ts`>
- <Pattern 2: e.g., Use repository pattern for data access>
- <Pattern 3: e.g., Components are co-located with their tests>

### Naming Conventions
- Files: <e.g., kebab-case for utilities, PascalCase for components>
- Functions: <e.g., camelCase, verb-noun format>
- Types/Interfaces: <e.g., PascalCase with descriptive names>

## Gotchas

<!-- Known issues, traps, or surprising behaviors -->

- <Gotcha 1: e.g., The `legacy-db` module has connection leaks - always wrap in `withConnection()`>
- <Gotcha 2: e.g., Date parsing is timezone-sensitive - always use ISO format>
- <Gotcha 3: e.g., The auth middleware must be applied AFTER body parsing>

## Technical Debt

<!-- Known issues that need addressing -->

- <Debt 1: e.g., `src/old-auth/` should be migrated to new auth system>
- <Debt 2: e.g., Test coverage below 80% in `src/payments/`>

## Ralph Loop Integration

If `.pi/ralph/AGENTS.md` exists, it contains lessons learned from autonomous ticket processing.
Read it for accumulated wisdom from previous implementations.

To initialize Ralph tracking:
```bash
./bin/irf ralph init
```
