# Add examples for hint-based override and --no-deps

## Origin
From review of ticket: ptw-6dza
File: prompts/tf-backlog.md

## Issue
The Examples section in prompts/tf-backlog.md could benefit from:
1. An explicit example of the hint-based override behavior to help users understand when/how keyword detection works
2. An example showing `--no-deps` usage for better discoverability

## Severity
Suggestion

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add example showing hint-based override (keyword detection) behavior
- [ ] Add example showing `--no-deps` flag usage
- [ ] Ensure examples are clear and demonstrate the value of these features
