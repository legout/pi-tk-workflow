# Document versioning + release steps in README/docs

## Task
Document the versioning scheme and the human release process (bump → changelog → tag) in README and/or docs.

## Context
Seed calls for SemVer and predictable releases; the workflow should be easy for maintainers to follow.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] SemVer policy documented (what triggers major/minor/patch).
- [ ] Release checklist documented (update version, update changelog, create git tag).
- [ ] Document where the canonical version lives.

## Constraints
- Keep documentation short and actionable.
