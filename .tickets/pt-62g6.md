# Wire packaging/entrypoints so tf console script uses tf namespace

## Task
Update pyproject entrypoints so the installed `tf` command runs code from the new `tf` package.

## Context
We are migrating the canonical implementation from `tf_cli` to `tf` but must keep the CLI stable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Installed `tf --help` still works
- [ ] No duplicate/competing entrypoints remain
- [ ] Add/adjust a smoke test covering the console script (if feasible)

## Constraints
- Avoid breaking existing workflows (Ralph, prompts, etc.)

Changes:
- Created new tf/ package with __init__.py and cli.py
