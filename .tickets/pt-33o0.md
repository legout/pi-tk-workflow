# Extract inline web UI CSS into a dedicated stylesheet served by Sanic

## Task
Move remaining inline `<style>` blocks from templates into a single CSS file and serve it from the Sanic app.

## Context
Separating CSS from templates makes iteration easier and avoids duplicating style blocks across pages. It also sets up future theming.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Create a CSS file (e.g. `tf_cli/static/web-ui.css`).
- [ ] Serve it via Sanic static route and reference it in `base.html`.
- [ ] Remove (or significantly shrink) inline `<style>` blocks in `base.html` and `index.html`.

## Constraints
- Keep paths robust; prefer `app.static(...)` or equivalent Sanic static handling.
