# Implement web server CLI command for tf ui

## Task
Add web server command to serve tf ui via browser.

## Status
**CLOSED as duplicate** - Consolidated into pt-fo58. See pt-sd01 for stack decision (Sanic+Datastar).

## Context
Based on the spike decision, implement the chosen web approach. This includes adding the CLI command and basic server infrastructure.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Add `tf ui --web` flag or `tf web` command (decide based on spike)
- [ ] Implement web server startup with configurable host/port (default: 127.0.0.1:8000)
- [ ] Add --host and --port CLI options
- [ ] Implement graceful shutdown with Ctrl+C handling
- [ ] Add basic logging for server events
- [ ] Ensure existing `tf ui` (terminal mode) continues to work unchanged
- [ ] Add error handling for port conflicts and startup failures

## Constraints
- Server must bind to localhost by default (security)
- Port must be configurable to avoid conflicts
- Must not break existing terminal TUI functionality
- Use existing business logic from tf_cli/ui.py where possible
