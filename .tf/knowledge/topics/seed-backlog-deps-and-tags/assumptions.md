# Assumptions: backlog-deps-and-tags

- Users want less manual ticket setup, not more
- Seed/baseline/plan content contains enough signal to infer reasonable dependencies
- Component-based parallel processing (Ralph) is a common use case
- A simple keyword-based component classifier is sufficient for MVP
- Tickets created by `/tf-backlog` are typically worked on in the order they were created
