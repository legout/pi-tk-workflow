# Constraints: add versioning

- Must not break existing CLI workflows; adding version output should be additive.
- Keep the implementation lightweight (no heavy release tooling required for MVP).
- Version source of truth must be unambiguous and easy to update.
- Avoid introducing dependencies unless clearly justified.
