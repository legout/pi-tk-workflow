# MVP Scope: add versioning

## In scope
- Decide and document a version source of truth.
- Expose version via CLI flag(s) (at least `--version`).
- Add `CHANGELOG.md` with an initial section and contribution guidance.

## Out of scope (for MVP)
- Automated release pipelines (CI/CD publishing).
- Complex changelog generation from commits.
- Backport support / LTS policy.
- Multi-package monorepo version orchestration.
