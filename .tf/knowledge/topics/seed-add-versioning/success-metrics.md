# Success Metrics: add versioning

- Users can reliably retrieve the installed version via CLI (e.g., `tf --version`).
- Every released version has an entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Releases are tagged in git and can be correlated to specific changes.
- Reduced time to diagnose issues because reports include a version string.
