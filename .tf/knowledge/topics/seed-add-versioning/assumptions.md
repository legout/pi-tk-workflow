# Assumptions: add versioning

- The project is distributed and/or executed in a way where a version string can be surfaced (Node package, bundled CLI, etc.).
- The repo uses git, and tagging releases is acceptable.
- Consumers value stable, documented change management.
- Version information should be available without network access.
