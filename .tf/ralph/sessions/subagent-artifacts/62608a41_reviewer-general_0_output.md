Review complete. I've written the review to `.tf/knowledge/tickets/ptw-5wmr/review-general.md`.

**Summary:** The implementation is solid with no critical or major issues. The version consistency check is well-designed—offline-safe, warning-only, and follows existing code patterns. I noted one minor issue about a slightly misleading info message when package.json exists but lacks a version field, and two suggestions for potential future improvements (empty version validation and version prefix normalization).
