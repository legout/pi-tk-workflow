## Review Complete: ptw-5yxe

I've completed the second opinion review for ticket **ptw-5yxe** and written it to:

**`.tf/knowledge/tickets/ptw-5yxe/review-second.md`**

### Summary

**No issues found.** The implementation is solid and complete.

### Key Findings

**Verified:**
- Flag documentation in `docs/commands.md` matches the actual prompt files exactly
- Step 6 placement in workflows.md is logically correct (after backlog generation, before Ralph)
- Both the typical tool sequence and manual `tk link` fallback are documented
- Terminology is consistent with the broader workflow context

**Positive notes:**
- The fallback workflow is clearly explained with concrete examples
- Command purposes are succinctly described (component tags for parallel safety, deps for sequencing)
- Cross-references between `/tf-backlog` and the correction tools are well done
