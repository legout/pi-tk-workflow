**Review complete for ptw-5yxe**

Wrote review to `.tf/knowledge/tickets/ptw-5yxe/review-general.md`

**Summary:**
- **0 Critical, 0 Major** issues
- **2 Minor** formatting/consistency suggestions
- **2 Suggestions** for potential documentation enhancements

The implementation is solid. The Step 6 placement in the Greenfield Development workflow is exactly right, and the typical sequence (`/tf-backlog` → `/tf-tags-suggest --apply` → `/tf-deps-sync --apply`) is clearly documented. Minor notes on formatting consistency and potential cross-references between sections.
